In the upcoming semester, I will continue to study the fundamental concepts of electrical engineering, including alternating current (AC) circuits. I plan to learn about the characteristics of sinusoidal AC, the effective value, peak value, and phase angle. Additionally, I will study the analysis of pure resistive, inductive, and capacitive circuits, the calculation of impedance, and the formulas for AC power (active, reactive, and apparent power).

To deepen my understanding of these core concepts and formulas, I will continue to systematically organize the key points from the course into notes. My notes will include class explanations, textbook examples, and the formulas and problem-solving techniques I develop. I will also incorporate hand-drawn phasor diagrams and circuit diagrams to help me visualize and better understand the behavior of AC circuits.
